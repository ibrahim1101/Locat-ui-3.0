# Locat UI3 current handoff — 2026-10-15

Continue the full authorized roadmap without routine approval questions. Preserve the current UI3 theme, all 49 original requirements and the complete A–AM ecosystem scope. A commit is a checkpoint, not completion of the project.

## Repository and boundaries

Work only on `integration/locat-core` in `ibrahim1101/Locat-ui-3.0`; application sources/scripts are in the nested `locat-ui-3.0` directory. Read the repository AGENTS.md. The original Locat repo is a read-only feature reference. Ordinary development commits/publication are authorized; main merges, public deployment/DNS, releases, paid resources and destructive changes require separate authorization. Preserve data and use additive schema changes only.

## Current implementation

The latest production-source changes are in `353ca2b5a28302860aff548a95aa3917142dc4c4`; browser cleanup follow-up `f3a41830cca43b13565f8d1914b136c5eada512d` changes only the test fixture and engineering history. Both are published on the development branch.

Photos now has bounded undo/redo, pointer drawing with cancellation, basic source-file information, local tags/search, explicit SHA-256 duplicate comparison, an import-date timeline and optional persistent thumbnails for eligible new imports. Originals remain the inputs for editing/export/duplicate comparison and original downloads. Timeline is based on browser imports, not camera dates, and excludes server timestamps. Read [PHOTO_EDITING.md](PHOTO_EDITING.md) for cache/drawing/scan/history limits and legacy fallback.

Media storage now aborts synchronous batch failures instead of partially committing earlier puts. A failed cached import retries the same new IDs once without thumbnails. Local hydration controls device readiness independently of server loading; imports await that hydration before publishing additions. Server requests retain expected-owner headers, deadlines, cancellation and generation guards. Unknown server inventory is not reported as a confirmed empty host configuration.

Existing account/session consistency, private encrypted stores, Sentinel incident/token/export flows, Link pairing/transfers and the managed Matrix/SAS/history foundation remain intact. Matrix private conversation APIs remain gated with 501; encrypted history-key import/export is not identity recovery. Never label preview data as live or equate browser/source checks with native certification.

## Validation checkpoint

Local production-source checks passed: TypeScript, lint, 250 frontend tests across 62 files, 105 backend tests and production build. Additional fixture lint and browser discovery passed.

CURRENT_CI: workflow 38784656103 at f3a41830cca43b13565f8d1914b136c5eada512d / browser job 116593436148 passed seven scenarios in 40.7 seconds and three separate foundation repetitions in 12.5 seconds. This includes persisted native WebP inspection, 800×400-to-320×160 resizing, original PNG preservation and local-card/import readiness while fixture server inventory is paused. All four workflow jobs succeeded: Ubuntu, macOS, Windows and Chromium.

Timeline source 488a4fb / workflow 38781851921 passed all four jobs; its browser job passed seven scenarios in 40.4 seconds and three foundation repetitions in 12.2 seconds. Later thumbnail run 38783128218 failed a fixture blob-fetch inspection; run 38784072597 then failed paused-route cleanup. The current fixture reads native IndexedDB and awaits route completion before removing the handler, retaining error propagation and the production CSP. See [ENGINEERING_HISTORY.md](ENGINEERING_HISTORY.md) and [BROWSER_FOUNDATION_ACCEPTANCE.md](BROWSER_FOUNDATION_ACCEPTANCE.md).

## Next work

The current source/fixture checkpoint has observed CI acceptance. Continue independently implementable roadmap work; observe and investigate new CI results when source changes. Prioritize the remaining communication/key-recovery foundation before enabling conversations: use pinned SDK code/primary protocol sources, preserve proof/account/device/contact checks, and require actual Synapse plus browser acceptance. Other open media scope includes explicit EXIF/capture-date behavior, legacy thumbnail lifecycle, backup/sync and permission-controlled sharing.

Native installers, physical devices, hardware codecs, TURN/network capture/control, full identity recovery, federation and public hosting remain separate incomplete acceptance/work streams. Do not treat them as implemented merely because a shell or source job exists.

Run `npm run check`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test:all` and `npm run build` from the application directory for meaningful source batches. Matrix changes additionally need the existing pinned Synapse acceptance. Local browser binaries are unavailable; actual Chromium execution is provided by CI. Terminal fetch works; publication uses connected GitHub Git-data tools with exact tree verification and an expected-head lease, without force.
